# ACO Portal




## Background


"ACO" = Aircraft Certification Office. 


For practice purposes only (unless the FAA finds this useful), I am creating an app that I wish we had at my previous office when I worked with the Federal Aviation Administration.


This is going to be an app that functions as a portal between the local aircraft certification office and the people that the office serves.  


Here is the initial concept, on paper:

**I'm in the market for a full time position**, preferably either in the Los Angeles area, where I currently reside, or in Las Vegas, where I intend to be.  I love to build and look forward to mastering any technology that your company uses.  My preferred architecture is currently Node/Express/React/Mongo (MERN) and for any real heavy backend implementations: .NET Core, to include SQL Server, Entity Framework, Identity Server, LINQ, etc.
